# First-Python-Project-Bank-Marketing-Analysis

##### Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions
********
**Project Overview:**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various client and campaign attributes. Using a publicly available dataset from a bank marketing campaign, we explore, preprocess, and analyze the data, followed by model training and optimization.

****************
**Business problem**
- The dataset contains information on a marketing campaign, including client details and previous campaign outcomes. The target variable is whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (y).

**The data set**
- Dataset: We'll utilize the publicly available dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [Bank Marking](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing).

*********
**Steps:**

- Load the dataset.
- Check for and handle missing values.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Normalize numerical features.
- Model Building:  We'll construct three distinct models using different machine learning algorithms:
1. Decision Tree
1. Random Forest
1. Logistic Regression

- Model Evaluation & Comparison: Each model's performance will be meticulously evaluated, allowing us to identify the most effective model for predicting customer behavior in this specific scenario.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: We'll further refine the chosen model by optimizing its hyperparameters using GridSearch, a technique for efficiently exploring a predefined set of hyperparameter values.

- Prediction: Finally, we'll leverage the optimized model to generate predictions on the dataset.
